## Abstract
The rapid pace of urbanization has resulted in significant traffic congestion in urban areas worldwide. This has led to several issues, such as increased air pollution, economic losses, and fuel waste. To address these issues, it is essential to develop innovative and sustainable mobility solutions. Micro-mobility is emerging as a promising option for efficient and sustainable urban transportation, and it can be studied using agent-based models (ABMs). ABMs offer several advantages for analyzing urban transportation and sustainability, including the ability to model complex systems, explore multiple scenarios, and study the effects of individual behaviors on the system as a whole. This paper aims to investigate the impact of micro-mobility solutions on urban transportation in Sri Lanka, which is currently facing significant traffic issues. The study utilizes two ABMs created with MATSim. The first model is based on current traffic data from Kandy city and is used to identify the most congested areas and time periods. The second model is based on a simple network and focuses on introducing bicycle lanes parallel to main roads to reduce traffic congestion. The study compares the results and evaluates the impact of micro-mobility on traffic congestion. The findings of the study suggest that micro-mobility solutions, such as introducing bicycle lanes parallel to main roads, can significantly reduce traffic congestion in urban areas. The study concludes with a discussion of potential improvements to the model and future research directions. Overall, this research highlights the potential of micro-mobility in achieving sustainable outcomes in urban transportation and emphasizes the importance of utilizing ABMs for the analysis of transportation systems.
