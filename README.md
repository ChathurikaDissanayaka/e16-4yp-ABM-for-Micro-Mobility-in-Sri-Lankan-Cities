# Agent based Model for Micro-Mobility in Sri Lankan Cities
___
## Aim
To explore an Agent-Based Model for micro-mobility in Sri Lankan cities with different 
geographical characteristics and transport infrastructure (i.e., Colombo, Galle, Kandy, 
Kurunegala), with a focus on how different policy decisions and environmental variables affect 
various response variables (energy consumption, travel times, congestion, air quality and cost).

## Background and Short Description of the project:
The rapid urbanization and urban spread in developing countries create a huge number of 
challenges urban planners have to face. For example, congestion has become a major issue in Sri 
Lanka and caused huge economic losses, wastage of fuels, and air pollution. It increases stress and 
frustration among motorists and passengers. Unsafe driving is the main impact of traffic jams 
which may lead to road mishaps and hence injuries. Traffic jams can also have a negative impact 
on the mind of a person. Tackling such an issue requires huge improvements in the city's 
organization and infrastructure. 

Micro-mobility is increasingly recognized as a transformative solution for sustainable 
urban transport, promising its potential to increase flexibility, energy efficiency, noise reduction, 
low demand for parking space, and no exhaust pollution. These devices, which include bicycles, 
scooters, skateboards, segways, and hoverboards can be a positive force in disrupting private 
vehicle use, especially for short-distance travel. It is necessary to have a proper case study before 
applying micro-mobility in Sri Lankan cities since it can cause traffic safety issues and operations 
as it increases the number of already complex interactions between modes. 

In this case, AgentBased Models (ABMs) can be used as a unique solution to model demand and supply variations in large transport networks and examine system impacts by looking at different perspectives.
The objective of this study is to assess the most suitable ABM for simulating micromobility in Sri Lankan cities and make suggestions according to different geographical 
characteristics of transport infrastructure for sustainable urban transport in terms of energy, health, 
environment, and economy.
